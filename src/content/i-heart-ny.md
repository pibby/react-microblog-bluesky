The journey from Connecticut to New York City on Metro North has a comforting familiarity. As the train glides past suburban stations and eventually along the coastline, the anticipation of a night in the city builds. Arriving at Grand Central Terminal is always magical - the celestial ceiling of the main concourse never fails to inspire awe, even after countless visits.

Our destination: Hell's Kitchen, specifically B Side Pizza & Wine Bar on 51st Street. Their pizza is a revelation - thick, crispy edges with a chewy interior, topped with perfectly caramelized cheese that creates those coveted crispy bits. The meat adds a little spiciness that the honey balances out with its sweetness. The perfect NYC bites.

After dinner, it was a short walk to the Music Box Theatre for what would prove to be one of the most remarkable theatrical experiences I've witnessed - Sarah Snook in "The Picture of Dorian Gray." Known to many as Shiv Roy from Succession, Snook demonstrates her extraordinary range by portraying 26 different characters in this adaptation of Oscar Wilde's classic novel. Through subtle shifts in posture, voice, and mannerism, she brings each character vividly to life, seamlessly transitioning between them in this technically ambitious one-woman show.

The production's innovative use of video projections and live camera feeds creates a haunting, multimedia exploration of vanity, corruption, and the price of eternal youth. It's no surprise the show has earned Tony nominations - Snook's tour de force performance alone is worth the price of admission.

The late-night train ride home provides time to reflect on the evening - the warmth of good food, the thrill of live theater, and the enduring magic of New York City nights.
